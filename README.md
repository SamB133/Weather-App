# Weather-App
 A Svelte web app that allows a user to enter a city or zip code and outputs the weather information for that location using the OpenWeatherMap API.

Use ```npm install``` to install all dependencies.

Get an API key from ```openweathermap.org``` for their Current Weather Data API.

Change the file name ```envExample.json``` to ```env.json``` and place the API key where it says in the file.

Use ```npm run dev``` to run the weather application and view it in your browser at ```http://localhost:5000```.
